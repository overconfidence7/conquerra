# Conquerra: Progress Log

*Plain-language record of where the project stands. Every session reads this first and adds a short entry at the end. Newest entries at the bottom.*

## How we work
- **Nate** decides what the game is and approves each step.
- **The orchestrator** (a Cowork session) plans the work, writes the prompts for Claude Code, reviews what comes back, and keeps this file and the design docs up to date.
- **Claude Code** writes the code, one milestone at a time, and ends every session with: what's done, what's next, and questions for Nate.
- **Every 3 Claude Code sessions**, the orchestrator writes a fresh orchestrator prompt (so a new orchestrator session can pick up cleanly) along with the next Claude Code prompt.

## Where things live
- Code and docs: `C:\Users\nkurt\Claude\Projects\Strategy Game` (and GitHub `overconfidence7/conquerra` once connected)
- Design: `docs/02-game-design-outline.md`, plus the newer ideas in `docs/04-design-additions.md`
- Build plan: `docs/03-build-plan.md`
- Decisions: `docs/decisions.md`
- Website (later): conquerra.overconfidenceonline.com

## Status right now
**Phase: design update (v0.2) before the real build kicks off.**

## Log

### Oct 1: Research and first design
- Researched Risk, War.app, Diplomacy, Supremacy 1914, Polytopia and others: what players love and the top complaints.
- Interviewed Nate; wrote the design outline v0.1 and the build plan.
- Picked hosting: Nate's existing Cloudflare account.

### Oct 2: Name, setup, early prototype
- Name chosen: **Conquerra**. Domain: overconfidenceonline.com. GitHub: overconfidence7.
- Claude (the planner, not Claude Code) built an early engine prototype ahead of plan:
  - turn system with order queues and backups, combat, economy, fog, a basic bot, and a simulator
  - 37 tests; 3,000 bot games with no crashes
  - It's in the folder, but it was built before the v0.2 design changes below. Nate will decide whether Claude Code keeps it as a starting point or starts fresh.
- **Correction from Nate:** the planner shouldn't write code. From here on, Claude Code writes code and the orchestrator writes prompts.
- **Correction from Nate:** turns are **5 minutes** to set orders, followed by a shared "what happened" replay where each player sees the results in their own visible area. (v0.1 assumed multi-day turns.)
- Nate shared a big batch of new ideas: easy-click diplomacy with counteroffers, contingency presets, generals you give instructions to, military vs. culture, three kinds of cards, and an event/mission deck. These are captured in `docs/04-design-additions.md`, with open decisions.
- Waiting on: Nate connecting GitHub, then a round of questions, then the kickoff prompts.
